			<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a
				short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is
				sexually dimorphic; male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the
				species.</p>
